gulp-release-it
=============

Provides an automatic way to do a release of your npm modules to Git and publish it to NPM Repository.

You can find a different documentation for version 1.x and 2.x as they works on different version of Gulp.
As Gulp was significantly modified in version 4, gulp-release-it has been adapted in version 2 to support it.
Apart from that version 2 contains more features.
